<h2>Configuration Steps</h2>

<p>

The post configuration setup of the osTicket system is shown in this tutorial.
 
Okay, fantastic! osTicket has been implemented from scratch. We will now concentrate on some post-installation setup and perform some system administration. New roles will first be configured within the help desk. Go to the Admin panel-> Agents -> Roles to accomplish this. We'll establish the Supreme Admin. Enter the name of the new role after selecting "Add new role." Additionally, you can alter any rolesâ€™ permissions. In this instance, they will have full permissions because we are generating a Supreme Admin. Remember that an agent's permissions are determined by their role, thus not every agent will have unrestricted access. If you correctly followed the instructions, your screen should appear like this. As you can see, we were successful in setting up the role of "Supreme Admin".

<p>
In the agents tab, click the "Departments" button. We will be able to establish a new department here. Depending on their designated job within the helpdesk, each Agent is assigned to a particular department. The "System Administrators" department will be established in this instance, and this is where the Supreme Admins will be identified. In the departments tab, you can configure additional particular parameters like SLAs, managers, and other email preferences.

We will establish a new team after configuring a new department. Teams give you the ability to assemble agents from several departments; for example, you may assemble an A team of the best technicians from a given department. You could, for instance, design a support topic that pertains to a product you make and assign it to a group of agents who are experts in that product. Go to Agents->Teams to form a team. In this example, a Level II support team will be created as a Level I support team has already been set up by default.

Now that a new team has been established, we will create a new setting to enable anyone to create tickets. Admin Panel > Settings > User Settings

<p>
The time has come to appoint Agents. The helpdesk personnel who really work on solving tickets are known as agents. When tickets are routed to a department, agents are given a primary department and position. Agents may be granted access to departments other than their own, and depending on whatever department they are in, they may also have varied tasks. In the Agents tab, you may allocate Teams, Access, and Permissions.
</p>
<br />

<p>
We'll create users after creating some agents. Users are clients who create tickets when they encounter problems. A user can be recognized by their email address. Follow this guide to create a user. Agent Panel > Users > User Directory > Add new.
</p>
<br />

<p>
SLAs Plans specify how long the help desk is supposed to take to resolve a particular ticket. By navigating to Admin Panel->Manage->SLA Plans, SLA Plans can be generated. Every SLA has a schedule, and during that schedule, a grace period is allowed. SEV-A in this instance has a 24/7 and an hour-long grace period.
